Radial basis functions
    Standard choice is a Gaussian
    First trains centers and sdevs using k-means
    Then trains weights using backpropogation
    Can use backpropogation to train centers and sdevs
    Why use Gaussian? Nonlinearity is an issue, but could use linear approx
        f(x) = -s*(x - c) + h, x-c > 0 and s*(x - c) + h, x-c < 0
        which is
        f(x) = -s*x + (h + s*c), x-c > 0 and s*x + (h + s*c), x - c <0
        
Universal approximator theorem
    d+1 dimensions can represent "anything" in d dimensions for feedforward NN
